**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

RESPONSE:
As someone working in the professional services industry with a specialization in technology consulting and compliance, ethics is a key consideration in my profession. It is important to take ethical implications into consideration from both the client perspective (such as data privacy concerns) as well as the external firm perspective (bias) when assessing a situation. However, considerations such as assessments of integrity and contents of databases and access restrictions to systems can be made to further incorporate additional components of ethics. 

Additionally, inequity in quality of opportunities and resources exists as an unfortunate reality in the professional services industry. These issues are further exacerbated by systemic biases which often exist implicitly within the workplace. Adjustments to address these components of inequity would be to foster an inclusive environment where juniors are not afraid to come forward with questions. This facilitates learning and helps build rapport which can be leveraged when opportunities present themselves in the future. 

As I gain additional experience in the industry, I will be better equipped to address both firm and client ethical and integrity concerns. By leveraging my expertise and professional competence, I anticipate that I will be able to make a notable impact.
